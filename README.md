# transcribe-analyse-video

Small POC to automatically transcribe voices in video/audio files to text and then analyzing the text data.

Motivation:
In this years keynote of Googles I/O, words like "AI" and "machine learning" were used a lot.
The idea is to use machine learning (in form of using a simple speech-to-text library) to count the occurrences of the phrase "machine learning" in Googles keynote :)

Goals:
 - learn about possible ways of transcribing speech-to-text in Python
 - learn about libraries for analyzing text data
 - find out how many time certain phrases are used in a transcript
 - (Compare to last years keynote)
